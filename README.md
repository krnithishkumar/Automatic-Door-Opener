# Automatic-Door-Opener
Open-Close Operation of the door is automated and controlled through Wi-Fi using nodeMCU.

# Abstract: 
  Security is a prime concern in our day-today life. Everyone wants to be as much secure as possible. An access control for doors forms a vital link in a security chain. The microcontroller based Door locker is an access control system that allows only authorized persons to access a restricted area. The system is fully controlled by Node MCU ESP 8266, Motor Driver L293D and gear motor. There are many security systems in the market nowadays. These systems are studied in order to obtain some idea for the project that was built. Although the system in the market nowadays is suite with new technology and more advanced the idea must still need to be obtain through the literature review. The literature review works help to expose and generate skills of searching for information from a various sources. These skills are very important in order to solve the problems that encountered or will face in the future. The system has many kinds of modules. One of them is wireless expansion module that act as receiver from the wireless resources such as Wi-Fi. This gives the idea for this project by using a mobile phone. It is quite complex system because have many ways to activate the control panel. For this project, the idea of using a wireless communication is adapted to build the system.
